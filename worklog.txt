understanding the code and the libraries i have to install, i worked on what i know so far which is making sure it connects to the site. im also going to try and figure out how to create the db if it doesnt already exits, had troubles figuring out, looked back to previous labs for solutions.

Figured out how to create database, with some help from https://pynative.com/python-cursor-fetchall-fetchmany-fetchone-to-read-rows-from-table/, struggles with the hash, this helped https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/python/how-to-calculate-sha256-hash-of-a-file-in-python.html, also this https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html.
Finished the database, not sure if database is gonna work at all as i havent been able to run the code.
Going to start with the get_image_path, I just relalized I couldve started wiht making the connections so im going to do that now
Going nice and smooth so far 
Used lots of my past labs for filling easy definitions
lab 9 was useful for download_apod_image
had problems with the hash but i came across this which helped a lot https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/hash-file#:~:text=Source%20Code%20to%20Find%20Hash&text=Hash%20functions%20are%20available%20in,and%20update%20the%20hashing%20function.
Going to stop for today.
Came back to it, started running the script  for the first time and trouble shooting the mistakes currecntly stuck on download_apod_image as my pictures varibales is saying it must be a integers even tho its a string
