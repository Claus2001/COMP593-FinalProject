Figured out how to create database, with some help from https://pynative.com/python-cursor-fetchall-fetchmany-fetchone-to-read-rows-from-table/, struggles with the hash, this helped https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/python/how-to-calculate-sha256-hash-of-a-file-in-python.html, also this https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html.
Finished the database, not sure if database is gonna work at all as i havent been able to run the code.
Going to start with the get_image_path, I just relalized I couldve started wiht making the connections so im going to do that now
Going nice and smooth so far 
had problems with saving the file, messed around for 20 min and i think i need to get the raw response this helped me. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16923898/how-to-get-the-raw-content-of-a-response-in-requests-with-python.
Going to stop for today.
